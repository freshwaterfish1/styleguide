Purpose

This will be a lot of links, and pull quotes. An ongoing colection of the very best advice to new folks getting started. A few place to start looking for things we'll want to include:

1. Jakon Neilen's [AlertBox](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/)
2. [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/topics)
3. Joe Clark's [Accessibility Articles](http://joeclark.org/access/webaccess/)



### Markdown

We'll be writing this in Markdown, which is a text format that looks clean, butwill output HTML for us. In the end, we'll release this HTML in an actual website.
